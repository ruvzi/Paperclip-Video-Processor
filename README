# = Video Conversion Processor
# This is a video processor module for Paperclip (http://thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip) that uses
# FFMpeg to convert uploaded videos to the format specified in the processor options. 
# 
# Because video processing takes a long time, it's recommended that this processor not be used synchronously.
# Instead, use it asynchronously by returning false in the applicable model for the before_post_process callback
# and then use a queue or a daemon to process new videos. 
#
